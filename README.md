# Parrot: Virtual assistant
Using APIs like Google's speech recognition, Google maps, Spotify, and others to create a virtual assistant that allows basic control of the user's machine and services they may choose to use. Skills learned: researching existing apps and innovating on them, using system resources efficiently, adapting, and learning to use third-party APIs. Features of the software include: playing songs on Spotify and controlling the client, controlling system sound, opening apps on the user's computer, searching the internet, having a conversation with the user, implementing a graphical user interface, and others.

Here are some terms, conditions and disclaimers!:

## Terms:
* Any user of this software does not have ownership of the software/code written, even if the user makes changes to the original code.
* This product is not used and should NOTÂ be used for commercial/business purposes.

## Conditions:
* I originally coded this project on python 3.7, and I have not tested to see if the code would work on earlier versions of python 3 or on any version of python 2
* In order for this software to run, you must install the required api's and make sure to have the latest version of python 3 by referring to https://www.python.org/downloads/  
* The project was coded on linux so the software should theoretically run on all UNIX machines however I would recommend adjusting the program according to the Operating System you use

## Usage of your data:

* The software is programmed so that if the user asks for the weather forecast without stating the location, the software sets the location as the city identified from the user's IP. The software does not hold, store, or use the user's IP for any other purposes. 
* In general, the program only stores reminders that the user wants to store. The storage is sole to a text file and to not cloud-based storage or anything someone can access.

## Optimum Experience:

* The speed and reliability of the software relies on how the sound is set up
* I recommend a medium microphone input level (40%-60%) if you are not going to speak loudly* or low input level(20%-40%) if you feel that you are going to be talking loudly
* The software is programmed to ignore background noise, but if the noise is loud and/or the noise of someone talking - it may be the case that the software takes longer, or hangs, as it waits for you to stop talking before it processes the instructions, or it may pick up information not spoken by the user

## User Changes:

* As the software is open-sourced, any user is entitled (and is encouraged to) make changes to the code to fit their needs. 
* If the user wishes to make changes, they should refer to the "TERMS" section
